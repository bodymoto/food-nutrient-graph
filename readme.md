A nutrition graph, originally inspired to help aid in keto dieting.<br/>
The JavaScript dynamically renders the HTML template based on an array of data.<br/>
Supports filtering by food group, or sorting by food data categories in either ascending (low-high) or descending (high-low) order.<br/>
<br/>
My first **Lit** project, using web component architecture (identical principle to React components).<br/>
My first **TESTED** project, using Open-WC and Web Test Runner, as recommended by the Lit documentation.<br/>
To launch the test suite, run: ```npm run test```
<br/>
Despite a challenging learning curve this one was a complete blast!
